### Basic SQL Queries
1. **Select all columns** from a table.
2. **Select specific columns** from a table.
3. **Use `WHERE` clause** to filter results.
4. **Use `ORDER BY`** to sort results in ascending and descending order.
5. **Use `LIMIT`** to restrict the number of results returned.
6. **Use `DISTINCT`** to remove duplicate values.
7. **Count the number of records** in a table.
8. **Find the average, minimum, and maximum values** of a numeric column.
9. **Use `LIKE` operator** for pattern matching in a string.
10. **Combine `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`** in a single query.

### Joins and Relationships
11. **Perform an `INNER JOIN`** between two tables.
12. **Perform a `LEFT JOIN`** to include all records from the left table.
13. **Perform a `RIGHT JOIN`** to include all records from the right table.
14. **Use `FULL OUTER JOIN`** to include all records from both tables.
15. **Use `JOIN` with multiple tables.**

### Aggregations
16. **Group results** using `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions.
17. **Filter grouped results** using `HAVING`.
18. **Use `COUNT` with `GROUP BY`** to count distinct values in a group.

### Subqueries
19. **Write a simple subquery** to fetch results.
20. **Use a subquery in the `WHERE` clause** to filter results based on another table.
21. **Use a subquery in the `FROM` clause.**

### Modifying Data
22. **Insert a new record** into a table.
23. **Update an existing record** in a table.
24. **Delete a record** from a table.

### Creating and Managing Tables
25. **Create a new table** with various data types.
26. **Add a primary key** to an existing table.
27. **Add a foreign key** to establish a relationship between tables.
28. **Alter a table** to add or drop a column.
29. **Drop a table** from the database.

### Indexing and Performance
30. **Create an index** on a table to improve query performance.
31. **Drop an index** from a table.

### Advanced Queries
32. **Use `CASE` statement** for conditional logic in queries.
33. **Use `UNION` to combine results** from two queries.
34. **Use `COALESCE` to handle NULL values.**
35. **Use window functions** like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()`.

### Transactions
36. **Begin a transaction**, perform multiple queries, and **commit the transaction**.
37. **Rollback a transaction** in case of an error.

### Views and Stored Procedures
38. **Create a view** to simplify complex queries.
39. **Update data through a view** (if applicable).
40. **Create a stored procedure** to encapsulate business logic.

### Data Types and Constraints
41. **Define different data types** (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE) in a table.
42. **Add constraints** like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK.

### SQL Functions
43. **Use built-in SQL functions** such as `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, and `SUBSTRING()`.
44. **Create a user-defined function** to encapsulate reusable logic.

### Backup and Restore
45. **Write a SQL command to backup a database**.
46. **Write a SQL command to restore a database** from a backup.

### Security and Permissions
47. **Grant and revoke permissions** for a user on a specific table.
48. **Create a new user** and assign them specific roles.

### Best Practices
49. **Write a query that adheres to best practices** for readability and performance.
50. **Document your SQL queries** to explain their purpose and logic.
